def create_readable_names_for_imagenet_labels():
  """Create a dict mapping label id to human readable string.
  Returns:
      labels_to_names: dictionary where keys are integers from to 1000
      and values are human-readable names.
  We retrieve a synset file, which contains a list of valid synset labels used
  by ILSVRC competition. There is one synset one per line, eg.
          #   n01440764
          #   n01443537
  We also retrieve a synset_to_human_file, which contains a mapping from synsets
  to human-readable names for every synset in Imagenet. These are stored in a
  tsv format, as follows:
          #   n02119247    black fox
          #   n02119359    silver fox
  We assign each synset (in alphabetical order) an integer, starting from 1
  (since 0 is reserved for the background class).
  Code is based on
  https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/data/build_imagenet_data.py#L463
